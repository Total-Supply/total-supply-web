## 💰 INVESTMENT BREAKDOWN

### Development Phase (8 weeks)
```
Infrastructure:     LKR 0     (all free tiers)
Team Payroll:       [Variable]
Total:              Depends on your team size
```

### First Year Operations
```
Month 1-3:          LKR 0/month (free tiers)
Month 4-12:         LKR 7,700-10,300/month (avg)
Year 1 Cumulative:  LKR 69,300-92,700 (~USD 540-720)
```

### Per Feature Cost
- Cost per feature: ~LKR 390 (LKR 70,000 ÷ 171 features)
- Cost per hour: ~LKR 325 (LKR 70,000 ÷ 214 hours)

### ROI Example (First Order)
```
Development cost (8 weeks):     [Your team payroll]
Infrastructure cost (Year 1):   LKR 70,000-93,000
First 1,000 orders @LKR 1,000 avg:  LKR 1,000,000 revenue
Order processing fee (2%):      LKR 20,000 profit
Payback on infrastructure:      Within first 1,000 orders ✅
```

## 📈 SCALABILITY

Your platform can handle:

| Users | Orders/Day | Infrastructure Cost | Timeline |
|-------|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| 500 | 100 | LKR 8,350/mo | Week 1-4 (MVP) |
| 5,000 | 1,000 | LKR 10,300/mo | Week 5-8 |
| 50,000 | 10,000 | LKR 20,800/mo | Month 3-6 |
| 200,000 | 40,000 | LKR 61,100/mo | Month 12+ |

**No rewrite needed.** Same stack scales infinitely with just config changes.
